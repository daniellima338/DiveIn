## **Design Choices**

### Fonts
 I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options. The font i use in this project are [Lobster] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster#standard-styles). The font is itallic as has a wavy look, which fits well with the diving theme. 

### Icons
I have used icons from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). There is a limited amount of icons. But they fit the corresponding text. 

### Colors

You can view my color scheme [here](assets/images/colors.png)

![Color Scheme](assets/images/colors.png)

The feel of the website should give you a feeling of the sensation of diving. 

* #0168C5: Is the primary background color. Many images will be used as backgrounds, but in places where there is not a picture as background, this soft blue color will do. 

* #1B442A: Is a much darker Blue color. It will be used as a divider throughout the page. 

* #f3fff3: Is a smooth Light-blue color. It will be used to highlight buttons around the website.

* #A8F1B8: Is a smooth Grey color. It will be used as overlay in different places. 

* #D82929: This is a plain White color. it will be used as text, to provide good contrast to the Dark-blue color used as background. 

I have used contract checker on Coolors in order to make sure that the contract is sufficient.
In this way my content will be easily readable. 

#### Changes made to color scheme

## **Structure**
The website structure is built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Bootstrap provides content for both CSS and JavaScript, as functionality with both is important.
As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile. 

### Home Page


### Countdown Page


### Quiz Page


### High Score 


### Tutorial



### **Wireframes**
I have decided to use [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 
First I created a wireframe for mobile, as the approach is mobile first. Thereafter wireframes for desktop and tablets.

## **Testing**

#### User story: As a user I want to be able to find new diving spots.
* **Plan**
The plan is to make a game that recreates a feeling of going into the jungle. The user needs to get a feeling that they have to be experts about animals to survive. The page has to be easy to navigate, and the game has to be easy to understand. If that is all achieved the user should have a good experience. 

* **Implementation**


* **Test**    


* **Result**  


* **Verdict**  



#### User story: As a user I want to be able to showcase my own diving experiences.
* **Plan** 
The user has to be able to see their score against other users. Here the user has to be able to put in their name and pin their score to a highscore board. 

* **Implementation**  


* **Test** 


* **Result** 

* **Verdict** 


#### User story: As a user I want to se other peoples diving experiences.
* **Plan** 
The user is supposed to play the game many times to remember the right answers as they go. I expect the user to get some answers right and some wrong, and therefore having to play the game again. 

* **Implementation**


* **Test**  


* **Result** 


* **Verdict**  

 

#### User story: As a user I want to be able understand what the website is about very quickly.
* **Plan** 
The plan is for the user to be able to contact the owner through a form if they go to the contact page. The contact page is not supposed to be very visible, as it is not a huge part of the application. 

* **Implementation**  

* **Test** 

* **Result** 

* **Verdict**
